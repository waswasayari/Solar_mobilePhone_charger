# Solar_mobilePhone_charger
This mobile phone charger has an input voltage ranging from 7V to 25V. It works with 9V solar panels as well as 18V and 21V solar panels.
The inspiration for this projecct came to me when I visited my home back in the village and discovered the challenges rural farmers underwent in order to recharge their mobile phones. With about half of the farmers owning different sizes of solar panels, the idea dawned on me, why not design an efficient solar powered mobile phone charger? 

Two weeks later I had a working prototype on a copper strip board, I subjected it to rigorous testing with solar panels of various ratings. With Everything working fine and achieving an efficiency of about 90%, I designed a PCB and placed an order for several pieces on JLCPCB. I 3D printed several casings for the charger and gave out several pieces to a few farmers in the village for testing. The testimonies from the farmers were positive.

I intended to mass produce this charger to meet the demands of the Farmers in my community but then i got a job offer that i could not turn down. Therefore , I have decided to share the project so that anyone can produce and use it for their own purposes.
